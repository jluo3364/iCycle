# Furniture Shop App UI - SwiftUI

We design two screens of a furniture shop app by using SwiftUI. The Home page at the top contains the menu and profile button. 
On the Details page of our furniture shop has full info of that product also add to cart at the bottom.


Changes:

Shop theme was changed from furniture to clothing. Theme colors modified.

Each item has its own price rather than the same price for everything. 

Clicking on a card brings the user to a new page with details corresponding to that item. Before, clicking on the any card brings the user to the same details page regardless of what item it was.
